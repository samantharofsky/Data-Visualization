In this project I learned how to use an object. This project was difficult for me because I had to find my own API and figure out how to store and display the data. I used object to pull the data from the API and display it on the canvas. I do not yet know how I can improve this project with my current skill set since this was my most recent project. However, look forward to figuring out how.
