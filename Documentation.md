Work Period
My effort during class today was a three.
I was completely focused on CS during the work period. 
I wanted to begin my R10 project. I had chosen a source before the break, so I just wanted to load the data into my Replit to begin the project. 
I struggled to locate the API of my source, and once I did, I got help on loading the data into my Replit. I also began brainstorming ideas for how to display the data. 
I hope to begin displaying data before my work period tomorrow.

My effort during class today was a three.
I was completely focused on CS during the work period. 
I wanted to start plotting data onto the canvas.
I instead familiarized myself with how to use the API and reviewed my R7 to remember how I completed a similar project. I also helped a peer with locating a database for their R10 and attempted to help them understand how to complete the project. 
I hope to begin displaying data before my next work period.

I struggled to create anything for my project today. I tried adding things to my code, but every time I did that I ruined my work. I have a clear plan for how I want to display my data, so I will do some research and get help to figure out how to complete my project. 
I hope to complete my project before my next work period. 

Work Period
My effort during the work period today was three. 
I was completely focused on CS and was productive with my time. 
I worked on my R10 project that is due tonight. I figured out how to use the keyPressed function to display the data. 
I completed my R10 project and turned it in on time. 
I hope to have my Semester 1 Wrap Up completed by the next work period.
